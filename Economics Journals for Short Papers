Extending the original blog by David Evans [ url: https://blogs.worldbank.org/impactevaluations/10-journals-publishing-short-economics-paper ] here is a list of journals that take short papers in Economics.



#1. AER Insights
“ Manuscripts must be <=6,000 words, with a maximum of five exhibits (figures or tables); for each exhibit before the maximum five, the authors may add up to 200 words toward the word limit; thus a paper with no exhibits must have <=7,000 words.”

#2. Review of Economics and Statistics
“Short Papers will be strictly held to a size limitation of 6000 words and 5 exhibits. For each exhibit before the maximum five, the authors may add up to 200 words toward the word limit; thus a paper with no exhibits must have <=7,000 words. Online appendix materials are allowed of modest length, no more than 20 pages, but the papers should be self-contained.”

#3. The Economic Journal, 6000 words, 5 exhibits
“In addition to our  regular submissions, the Journal also encourages the submission of short papers, along the lines of the AER:Insights style (<6,000 words, 5 exhibits). Submissions in this category should clearly state that they are intended as short, self-contained papers, and should be written accordingly.”

#4. Journal of Urban Economics: Insights
"JUE: Insights submission guidelines are the same as for AER: Insights.
Submissions must not be longer than 6000 words and 5 exhibits. For each exhibit before the maximum five, the authors may add up to 200 words toward the word limit; thus a paper with no exhibits must have <=7,000 words. Online appendix materials are allowed of modest length, no more than 20 pages, but the papers should be self-contained.”
Note: JUE: Insights will appear roughly once each year
